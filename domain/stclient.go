	// events will be returned.

	// Note: if more than one eventTypes filter is given, only subsequent events can be fetched. This function will wait
	// until a new event or timeout. However, if there's only one event type or empty, cached events can be fetched.
	// This is the intended behavior of Syncthing API, details: https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/8902
